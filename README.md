# cunysec.github.io

This is the landing page for people interested in CUNYsec. The site is built with the Jekyll framework and is hosted on Github. We also have a [Google Groups Page]() where all our announcements are. 

## Viewing the website locally (based on Mac)
1. Make sure you have 'jekyll' installed. If not, run `gem install jekyll` on the terminal.
2. On the terminal, navigate to the directory of the folder.
3. In the folder, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve up the local site. 
4. On your web browser, either go to 'localhost:4000' or '127.0.0.1:4000'.
5. Press 'ctrl+c' in the terminal to exit. 

## Website Objectives
* Find a Jekyll Theme (one that uses bootstrap)
* Implement Disqus for comments?
* Should we utilize Meetup for our meetings?
