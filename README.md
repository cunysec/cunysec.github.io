# cunysec.github.io

This is the landing page for people interested in CUNYsec. The site is built with the Jekyll framework and is hosted on Github. We also have a [Google Groups Page]() where all our announcements are. 

## Website Objectives
* Find a Jekyll Theme (one that uses bootstrap)
* Implement Disqus for comments?
* Should we utilize Meetup for our meetings?
