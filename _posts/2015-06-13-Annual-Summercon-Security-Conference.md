**What:** Annual Summercon Security Conference

**Why should I attend?**

* Lots of quality speakers and technical content http://www.summercon.org/schedule.html 
* Great networking opportunities
* Lots of cunysec folks will be there so you won't be along

**How do I buy a ticket?**

Unfortunately, this event is 21 and over because of the bar...
https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/808355 It's $75 dollars.

**Is it worth it?**

Two days of conference with technical topics, a chance to bond with fellow CUNY students and alumni - pretty good deal actually. In retrospect, attending Summercon as a student was always worth it.

Also consider that fact that it's a local conference so we're not spending money on hotel and travel. Going to Las Vegas for a conference easily runs $1000+...

PS The idea of cunysec started at this conference
