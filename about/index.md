###What is cunysec?

Loose collective of CUNY students, professors, and alumni interested in Digital Forensics and Information Security

###Why did we start cunysec?

The founding members saw an under representation of CUNY students and alumni in the security field in NY. We plan to change that bringing folks to collaborate and teach each other. CUNY has many sharp minds that just need a little direction. There’s a skills shortage in infosec, we’re building the pipeline.

###Where do we go?

Lots of security conferences and meetups like OWASP, Blackhat, Defcon, Shmoocon, CTFs, Hackathons etc.

###How do I subscribe to the mailing list?

This mailing list is primarily for CUNY students and alumni. Please send an email from your cuny.edu address along with a brief introduction and the address where you’d like to recieve messages. Once we sort out everything, we can more broadly distribute information to those outside of CUNY.

###What’s discussed on the mailing list?

Upcoming events, security news etc.

###Does cunysec cost anything?

Nope, we did this from the bottom of our hearts

###How can I help (CUNY person or not)?

Speak to student, give talks, contribute content, just be plain helpful.

###Short Term Strategy
* Encourage students to attend and participate in CSAW 2014.
* Continue to attend conferences to increase exposure.
* Schedule round table discussions giving students the opportunity to communicate with the entire community.
* Recruit other students and get support from CUNY faculty and staff.

###What happens in cunysec?
* Conference Attendance - One of the main ways to keep up with the fast changing environment is to attend conferences. Students will attend conferences in groups guided by CUNY alumni. This will make the experience more enjoyable and less intimidating.  
* Career Mentoring - CUNYSec will provide mentoring opportunities with CUNY alumni who work in the field providing insight on how to build your career.
* Networking - Hacking and forensic investigations aren’t purely about bits and bytes. We’ll give students a common ground to discuss security/forensics in person and build relationships they can leverage within CUNY and possibly the rest of their careers.
* Email Discussion Lists - A private email list for CUNY students by CUNY students to discuss relevant topics, conferences, competitions, and other activities.

###What we’d like to do more of the following:
* Security Research -  Complex technical problems are advanced by research, we’ll provide relevant topics and support for students who want to go beyond the classroom.
* Competing in Capture the Flags Competitions - One of the ways to gain practical skills in Information Security is by competing in CTFs. It can be intimidating to start, but we’ll mentor groups of students and provide direction to maximize their learning experience.
* Competing in Digital forensic challenges like DFRWS that will open the door towards international recognition.
Participation in Open Source Projects- An excellent way for CUNY students to practice their coding skills is by being involved in Open Source projects. This leads to real world experience and contribution to the Open Source community.
* Cross College Collaboration - CUNYSec will allow students from different CUNY campuses to work together. This will allow for efficient communication and collaboration among CUNY students from different campuses.
* Industry Partnerships and Presentations - We’ll bring professional speakers and researchers to provide different perspectives on information security topics and research.
* Career Opportunities - As CUNYSec members will span across academia and industry we hope to create a mutually beneficial and very unique network for internships and other opportunities. The intention is not to become a job board but it is to effectively share infosec career opportunities within the CUNY community as is seen among others.

###Who’s behind Cunysec?

Cesar Vargas has successfully participated in many cybersecurity and digital forensics competitions including CSAW and the Sleuthkit hackaton. He graduated on May 2014 from the Master’s degree in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity program at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. At John Jay he accomplished research related with honeypots, botnets, and malware. Malware research has been his passion for the last 3 years and as as part of his Master’s thesis he created a python framework called Malware Evolution Discovery System (MEDS). MEDS was presented at PyGotham in August 2014 and will be presented at the Open Source Digital Forensics Conference in November 2014. His main motivation for being a part of CUNYSec is to share his knowledge, experience, and passion about cybersecurity related topics with other CUNY members. [cesar@nacolabs.com]
