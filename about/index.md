###What is cunysec?

Loose collective of CUNY students, professors, and alumni interested in Digital Forensics and Information Security

###Why did we start cunysec?

The founding members saw an under representation of CUNY students and alumni in the security field in NY. We plan to change that bringing folks to collaborate and teach each other. CUNY has many sharp minds that just need a little direction. There’s a skills shortage in infosec, we’re building the pipeline.

###Where do we go?

Lots of security conferences and meetups like OWASP, Blackhat, Defcon, Shmoocon, CTFs, Hackathons etc.

###How do I subscribe to the mailing list?

This mailing list is primarily for CUNY students and alumni. Please send an email from your cuny.edu address along with a brief introduction and the address where you’d like to recieve messages. Once we sort out everything, we can more broadly distribute information to those outside of CUNY.

###What’s discussed on the mailing list?

Upcoming events, security news etc.

###Does cunysec cost anything?

Nope, we did this from the bottom of our hearts

###How can I help (CUNY person or not)?

Speak to student, give talks, contribute content, just be plain helpful.

###What happens in cunysec?
* Conference Attendance - One of the main ways to keep up with the fast changing environment is to attend conferences. Students will attend conferences in groups guided by CUNY alumni. This will make the experience more enjoyable and less intimidating.  
* Career Mentoring - CUNYSec will provide mentoring opportunities with CUNY alumni who work in the field providing insight on how to build your career.
* Networking - Hacking and forensic investigations aren’t purely about bits and bytes. We’ll give students a common ground to discuss security/forensics in person and build relationships they can leverage within CUNY and possibly the rest of their careers.
* Email Discussion Lists - A private email list for CUNY students by CUNY students to discuss relevant topics, conferences, competitions, and other activities.
