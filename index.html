<h2> What is Cunysec? </h2>
Loose collective of CUNY students, alumni, industry professionals, and professors interested in information security and digital forensics.
<h2> Why did we start Cunsyec? </h2>
The founding members saw an under representation of CUNY students and alumni in the security field. We plan to change that through collaboration and mentoring. CUNY has many talented students that could use a little direction. There is a skills shortage in information security, we are building the pipeline.

<h2> What happens in Cunysec?</h2>
<li> Attending security conferences and meetups like <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a>, Blackhat, Defcon, Shmoocon, CTFs, Hackathons  and so on.</li>
<li> Networking -We provide students and alumni a common ground to discuss digital forensics and information security in person. We hope these relationships can be leveraged within CUNY and possibly the rest of their careers.</li>
<li> Email list for annoucements, questions, and discussions.</li>
<li> Presentations by industry professionals, CUNY alumni, and brave students. </li>

<h2>Does Cunysec Cost Anything?</h2>
Nope, we do it from the bottom of our hearts
